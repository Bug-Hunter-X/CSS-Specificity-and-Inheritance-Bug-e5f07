The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

.container p {
  color: green;
}

.container p span {
  color: purple;
}
```

In this example, the `p span` selector is more specific than `.container div`, leading to the `span` element inheriting the `color` from the `p` element instead of inheriting from the parent `div`. This unexpected inheritance can lead to unexpected colors and styling issues.
