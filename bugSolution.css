To solve this issue, the color of the `div` within `.container` should be explicitly specified:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red !important;
}

.container p {
  color: green;
}

.container p span {
  color: purple;
}
```

Using `!important` ensures that the `color: red` declaration overrides the inheritance from the less specific `div` selector.  However, using `!important` should be done sparingly.

Alternatively, increase the specificity of the `div` selector within `.container` to override the inheritance by adding an extra class or id to the `div` element if using !important is undesirable.
